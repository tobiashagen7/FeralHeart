The exports folder is used for installing custom maps, in most cases it's just to chuck in file types that include:
.fhm
.fho
.fhs
.fhw

The custom map can then be found in "Cape Of Distant Worlds".

The exports folder is also used by the map maker in the game, and any exported map will be placed here.
