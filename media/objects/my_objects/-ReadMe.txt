HOW TO IMPORT OBJECTS TO THE GAME
--------------------------------------
1.Drop all the files in here for the objects such as:

.mesh
.material
.jpg
.png
.particle

--------------------------------------

2.Import the meshes, particles etc in the object maker in the game:

-Meshes are loaded by writing "nameofmesh.mesh" in the mesh field.
-Particles are loaded inside of the effect maker in the object maker by writing the name.
-Materials can be loaded by changing the material field in the object maker(It's CAPS sensitive)

--------------------------------------

3.Save the objects into an object group by providing a name and group for the Object you loaded.

-DO NOT PLACE CUSTOM OBJECTS INTO THE STANDARD GROUPS like MyTrees or MyRocks, please make a new group for YOUR objects.
(This to prevent faulty custom maps when sharing or overwriting objects in the Official maps)
